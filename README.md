# sortingAlgorithmsProject
This repository contains the final submission for COMP0005, a first-year coursework project. The project includes both a written report and a codebase implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) using Google Colab (link to notebook).

The goal of the project was to compare the effiency of different sorting algorithms for convex hulls.

Chan's Algorithm Implementation: Coding Chan's algorithm proved particularly challenging due to its mathematical complexity. I referenced an older, non-functional GitHub implementation and adapted it to our needs, though the result remains suboptimal in terms of performance.

This project was initially a group effort. However, a significant portion(more than shown in the report) of the implementation and coordination fell to me. As such, this repository largely reflects my work and approach to solving the challenges posed by the coursework.
