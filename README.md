# sortingAlgorithmsProject
This is a group project for COMP0005 of our first year course

Typical Uni project rant:

Although I am definitely not proud of the final product, I feel satisfied that I was at least able to pull this off under the circumstances I was in.

The entire thing was basically done by me alone. One out of the 4 group members was literally missing, another member was not able to produce anything usable at all(she was still given 10% work contribution because at least she tried (by copy and pasting chatGPT responses then not caring))

The other group member who had equal contribution was trying his best to help which I appreciate. However, if I had spent the time doing the project all by myself instead of explaining and telling him what he should do, the end result would have probably been the same.

We were given around 1 month to complete the project which is more than enough. Unfortunately, I made the decision to spend a lot more time working on another coursework(Java Web Dev) which was also released at around the same time. We were taking it slow for the first 3 weeks and it was too late until I realized I am going to be alone grinding this project 8 hours a day within a week.

Actual Description:

The final submission included a report describe what we're doing and the codebase in a .ipynb file, we worked through Google colab (link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TGRufU0afUTotSs_cv-qKvnrOuqkpPpq#scrollTo=PLVBxTkuGlnB)

For the chan's algorithm part, it is might look confusing because I honestly had no idea on how to code it considering the maths involved is beyond my pay grade. I tried my best to implement it by copying a old codebase on github which is many years old and does not work. I fixed it to a degree but it is just not working as intended(it is incredibly slow)
